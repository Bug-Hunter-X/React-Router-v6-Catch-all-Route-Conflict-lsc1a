This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes ('*') in React Router v6.  The problem arises when the catch-all route unintentionally overrides other defined routes, leading to incorrect page rendering. The solution shows how to correctly place the catch all route to resolve this. The `bug.js` file demonstrates the issue, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.
